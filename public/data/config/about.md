VueBlog32 is a simple Blog app written in Vue 3.2. It utilizes `Composition API`, `Pinia`, `Vite`, `Axios`, `Bulma`, and `Marked`.

There are several purposes for VueBlog32. I wanted to have a simple blog web site, I wanted to write something in the latest Vue framework (When I did this: Vue 3.2), and I did not want to use a database. VueBlog32 does all of that.
